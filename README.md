# GroupA_Data_Science_Jobs

This is the public repository for Group A.
The member of this group are: Bengusu Ozcan (bo2297@columbia.edu), Davide Vaccari (dv2438@columbia.edu), Dylan Rosenthal (dr3118@columbia.edu), and Silvia Sunseri (ss6105@columbia.edu).

We have investigated Data Scientist jobs in the US. Since we are studying to become Data Scientists, we liked the idea to investigate the topic more. After a general overview, we focused also on the gender pay gap among Data Scientist in the US.
